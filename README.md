#Boilerplate

This boilerplate is framework agnostic, mobile first, and only contains a simple html file to get you started.

It includes some basic Grunt tasks as well as some basic LESS styles.

###Grunt

To get started navigate to your site directory and run:

'grunt watch'

This will watch for changes in:

```
resources/less/style.less
resources/js/scripts.js
```

- [grunt](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt)
